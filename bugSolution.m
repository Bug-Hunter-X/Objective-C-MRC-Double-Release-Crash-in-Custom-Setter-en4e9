The corrected `setString:` method:

```objectivec
- (void)setString:(NSString *)newString {
    if (myString != newString && myString != nil) {
        [myString release];
    }
    self.myString = [newString retain];
}
```

This modified version ensures that `myString` is only released if it's different from `newString` and not nil, thus eliminating the double release bug.  Using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is highly recommended to avoid such complexities.
